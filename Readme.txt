Hello everone i have created this address book using fastapi with sqlite3 database
requirements for this project are as follows
fastapi
uvicorn
sqlalchemy

after creating main.py i have created basic models which think was required for an address book then i attached them
with main.py and also attached them with database so that our data will be saved for future use.
in that address book we guys can read, post, update and delete data easily
